# THE WINEBRARY

By Gatwiri Murithi

## Description

The Winebrary is my third independent project and the first application built entirely with React js. It is a project, which brings together two of my favorite passtime activities; Reading and mixing fruity beverages. The app is sort of an interactive e-commerce site to enable the user make purchases on the products and update status on their favorite books and cocktails.

### Let's Set Up!

Create the repository for your project and clone it to your local environment.

Use create-react-app. Read up more on https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.

Start on your new project and you're ready to go!
